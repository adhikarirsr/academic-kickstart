This is my attempt to keep track of interesting science related websites and blogs
### Blogs
1. https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/

### Websites
1. John Carlo Baez
  * http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ \\
    This webpage has many interesting topics. I particularly find his exposition to information geometry (http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/information/) very useful.
  * http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/stoch_stable.pdf \\
    Quantum Techniques for Stochastic Mechanics. A monogram, I hope to go through one day.
2. Gavin E. Crooks
    * http://threeplusone.com/gec/
    * http://threeplusone.com/FieldGuide.pdf (Field Guide to Continuous Probability Distributions)
    * http://threeplusone.com/on_information.pdf (On Measures of Entropy and Infromation)
