As a Ph.D. student, we are exposed to lots of new ideas and concepts. The posts on websites are my attempt to keep track of those ideas and concepts. I started a blog a couple of years ago but failed to maintain it. This is my second go at it.

I set up this website using Hugo framework with the academic theme. I have high hopes from this set up as it natively supports $\LaTeX$.
