For the past year or so, I have been dabbling in machine learning. Last summer, I decided to spend some serious amount of time exploring ML. As a beginner, I got overwhelmed by the plethora of resources out there. Meanwhile, I convinced one of my friends to go on this exploration with me. We decided to go through lectures on _machine learning by Andrew Ng_. The idea was to watch his old _Coursera_ lectures and meet once a week and discuss those ideas.

Fortunately that summer, I also got an opportunity to mentor a high school student. He wanted to explore some computer science related topic. So, I decided to teach him machine learning. This decision forced me to pick a book and some sets of lecture notes. I choose _Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML)_ by Christopher Bishop and _Deep learning specialization by Andrew Ng_. With the added responsibility of teaching, I strated going through first few chapters of _PRML_. Based on _PRML_ and _Deep Learning specialization_, I made lecture notes so that I could convey those ideas clearly. It was fun!

In the mean that I came across some other very useful resources. Here’s a list of some of those resources:
### Support Vector Machine

  * One of the most gentle and clear introductions to SVM by [Patrick Winston] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PwhiWxHK8o&t)

  * Interesting and very helpful SVM recitation session by [Jessica Noss] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik7E7r2a1h8)

###  Machine Learning lectures by Nando Freitas
I haven’t gone through the whole lecture series. However, I watched quite a few lectures by him and they are some of the clearest [introductions those topics on ML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2OtwL5T1ow&list=PLE6Wd9FR--EdyJ5lbFl8UuGjecvVw66F6) that I found on youtube.

###  Machine Learning lectures by Ali Ghodsi
One of the hidden gems of youtube [Machine learning lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKJNzy_GuvX3SAg3ipaGa8A/playlists)
. I have watched a couple of this lecture and they are brilliant. I would highly recommend his lecture on Decision Tree.

This is by no means a complete list. I went through many more resources. I will add those and the ones that I am currently going through soon.
